# java-course

The topics covered here should give you enough to be able to create your own web applications.

- Java basics
- JOOQ and postgresql
- Quarkus REST applications
- Elasticsearch interaction
- ActiveMQ (Artemis) interaction

There are also some challenges that you can give a go at

# Challenges
Before you go at it, make sure the repo is cloned to your machine, then, using Git, create your own branch so you don't mess up the main files. Also so I can review the changes

## Section 1
The project in this repo contains a java program with a bunch of errros, so you'll need to fix them all and run through the application. There are a few questions that you can answer to check if you know some key facts

## Section 2
This one requires you to create a program, the desription is in the readme of that project

## Section 3
This one is also about creating a project, and then just some abstract concepts that need to be implemented in some classes

## Section 4
This one is just to get familiar with Gradle and Quarkus, so just watch the vids and then continue

## Section 5
The challenge will require you to modify the account-data project to convert the file based repository to a JOOQ based one

## Section 6 and 7
The last one for the Java work is to create a application that will combine elasticsearch and artemis to create a logging facility, I want to be able to use a class from you library module to log messages to elastic, these messages need to be routed through artemis, then indexed to elastic
