## Challenge
Create a program with a series of classes to represent employees working at a bank. They need to be dealing with 
accounts.

An employee can create an account, add money to it, get the balance, remove accounts and withdraw money from an account.

This is only to create classes that will facilitate these operations. So no program loop required, 
but it's always welcome
